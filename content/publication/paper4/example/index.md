abstract: With the development of deep space exploration technology, thermal control systems for space telescopes are becoming increasingly complex, leading to the key parameters of conventional thermal control systems are difficult to adjust online automatically. To achieve these adjustments, this paper provided detailed verification of the application of deep reinforcement learning to space telescope thermal control from three perspectives: thermophysical modelling,什么鬼？？？
